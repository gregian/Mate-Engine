# About the project

Mate Engine is a free alternative to the app **Desktop Mate**. This project exists because of the high price of Desktop Mate models, which range from **$10 to $25 USD**. Considering that full games are available at these prices on Steam and other platforms, paying **$20 to $25 USD** for a simple idle model feels unfair to many users.

Another reason for developing **Mate Engine** is that **Desktop Mate** removed mod support, making it difficult to add custom VRM models. 

Now, with **Mate Engine**, you get most of what Desktop Mate offers **for free**, including support for custom VRM models!

# Better Transitions!

**MateEngine** features smoother transitions between animations compared to *Desktop Mate*—see for yourself! *Desktop Mate* often feels clunky, with glitchy transitions between different states. In contrast, **MateEngine** delivers seamless and fluid transitions, no matter the state.


# Performance
![Mate Engine Preview](https://i.imgur.com/MTbnIeE.png)

**MateEngine** is more lightweight compared to Desktop Mate in terms of CPU and GPU usage. Depending on the model you use, RAM usage may increase or decrease.  
In the example model "Alice", we use a high-quality model with around **190MB** of texture memory, which is why the program consumes approximately **200MB** of RAM in the example image.  
Using models with lower texture memory will result in lower RAM usage. Overall, **MateEngine** is slightly more performant and lightweight.

## Known Issues & Missing Features

## I Need Your Help! :tools:

If you have experience with **C#** or **Unity animations**, I would appreciate any help!

- I am not a **C# expert**, so any **pull requests** or contributions are welcome.
- If you're skilled in **Unity animations**, I need help creating **dragging, dancing, and idle animations**. I prefer to keep **Mate Engine** free, so I won’t be hiring paid artists—this is a community-driven project!

If you’re interested in helping, feel free to contribute! :rocket:

## Virus Detection Warning :warning:

If **Windows Defender** detects a potential virus named `Trojan:Script/Wacatac.B1ml`, **you can ignore it**. This is a **false positive** caused by the application not being digitally signed.

To verify that the application is safe, you can scan it using **VirusTotal** or other security services.
